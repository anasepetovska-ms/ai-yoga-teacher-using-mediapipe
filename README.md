Wouldn't you want to know if you have good posture while doing yoga or exercising? Do you want to know if you are doing yoga poses correctly and efficiently?

As someone who started my yoga practice at home, I wasn't always sure if I was doing the poses "right". Am I not pushing myself enough or maybe I am over-extending? 

The goal of this project is to create a tool that given a video feed will be able to categorize if a human body is doing poses efficiently enough, with good posture or not. 

Here is some preliminary research on the topic:
